I keep having to manually copy and paste stuff from 1password into either env files.
Or even more fun is hunting and pecking for the right value to copy it into another system.
Or try and use the `op` CLI, which allows for programmatic access to my secrets *but it's a bit of a faff to get actual values out nicely*.

So, what's the idea? Just building a higher level, more opinionated secrets management API on top of 1Password. I can foresee no challenges there.
